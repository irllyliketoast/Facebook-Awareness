        <p>Imagine if every time you had a conversation in your home, someone was standing outside your window, writing down everything you said, 
		noting who was in the room, and even keeping track of the furniture in your house. Sounds invasive, right? That’s essentially what 
		Messenger does—but instead of a stranger outside, it’s a multi-billion-dollar company, <i>Facebook.</i> Facebook Messenger isn’t just an 
		app for chatting—it’s one of the most invasive data collectors on your phone. While most apps gather some basic data, Messenger takes it 
		to a whole new level. If you have it installed, it’s not just tracking you—it’s collecting details from every device on the network you’re 
		connected to, including: <em> your IP Address, Device Name, </em>and<em> MAC Address.</em></p>
        
        <p>That means every time you connect to a Wi-Fi network, Messenger scans and logs every device on it. Your friend’s phone? <em>Logged.</em> 
		Your laptop? <em>Logged.</em> Even smart TVs and home assistants get recorded. And who owns this data? A private American company with <i>no 
		obligation</i> to protect your privacy.</p>
        
        <p>But this isn’t new—Facebook was <i>built</i> on stolen data. It started as “Facemash,” a Harvard project where Mark Zuckerberg hacked school 
		servers to steal student photos and create a website rating women’s attractiveness. That obsession with data theft never stopped. Facebook 
		didn’t innovate social media—it stole the idea from early networking sites like MySpace and Friendster. And when it couldn’t buy out rising 
		competitors like Snapchat or TikTok, it cloned their features instead.</p>
        
        <p>The bigger problem is that there are no formal ethical laws in cybersecurity. Companies like Facebook don’t have a legal obligation to 
		protect user data—they do the bare minimum, often after getting caught mishandling it. That’s how breaches like the Ashley Madison leak 
		happened. The site, known for facilitating extramarital affairs, stored highly sensitive user data without proper encryption. When hackers 
		exposed it, millions of users had their personal lives destroyed, leading to blackmail, divorces, and even some to take their own life. Or 
		take DeepSeek, where AI-generated deepfake leaks threaten privacy on a scale never seen before. The lack of clear cybersecurity regulations 
		means we’re constantly playing defense, waiting for the next major breach instead of preventing it. That’s why privacy isn’t just a software 
		issue—it’s a personal responsibility. We have to take cybersecurity seriously, not just when developing software, but also in our own homes. 
		That means limiting the data we share, questioning what apps we install, and understanding that if something is free—<i>we are the product.</i></p>
        
        <p>If you’re using Messenger, you’re feeding one of the most aggressive data-harvesting machines in history. Maybe it’s time to reconsider how 
		much access we’re giving to a company that built its empire on stolen information.</p>
